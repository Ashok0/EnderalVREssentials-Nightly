New Mods
- Strike Obstruction Systems - Combat Blocking Overhaul v1.0: Blocking can now mitigate damage from blocked Spells, Shouts, Enchants, and Poisons. Timed Blocks can provide greater mitigation, redirect parried spells & arrows, and inflict various debuffs. All features configurable via MCM (Light Plugin).

Updated Mods
- Enderal VR v2.9.0:  Reverted from 2.9.1 to 2.9.0 due to the latest version causing a crash to desktop on the beach after meeting Jespar.  2.9.1 should be manually enabled later in the game when playing tavern minigames.

Removed Mods
- Deflection v1.8:  Redundant with Strike Obstruction Systems - Combat Blocking Overhaul.
