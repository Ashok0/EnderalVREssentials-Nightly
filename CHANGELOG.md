Release date: December 14th, 2021

Updated Tools:
- DynDOLOD Standalone 3.0 Alpha-58: DynDOLOD is a set of simple tools based on xEdit/xLODGen to automatically create a Skyrim mod based on the load order which adds distant LOD for objects and trees to Skyrim. By combining DynDOLOD with xLODGen users can create drastically enhanced static object LOD + tree LOD and the new, optional dynamic distant object LOD in a few simple steps.

New Mods:
- Crash Logger VR v1.0: Generates crash logs when the game Just Worksâ„¢. This is a VR port using fudgyduff's MIT source.
- Improved Bound Sword and Dagger Collision v1.0: More accurate collision for the bound dagger and sword.
- A Follower Named Ishan v1.2: Adds a custom voiced Qyranian follower at the Drunken Bee in Riverville.

Updated Mods:
- Enderal SE - Bug Fixes v1.30: Updated for Enderal 2.0.10.
- VR Address Library for SKSEVR v0.17.0: Add support for dialoguemovementenabler (5de6061).  Add rememberlockpick angle offsets (6dcc78b).
- Embers XD v2.4.9: An Embers XD style makeover to hanging oil traps. An open smelter with coals inside, particle lights (Forges Add-On). A custom coal pile next to smelter (Forges Add-On).
- HIGGS VR v1.4.6: Another fix for one of Skyrim VR's [collision] bugs! The size of HIGGS's weapon collision is now scaled properly based on your hand size when using VRIK. This means that in general it will be smaller than before, as the default hand size for vrik is 0.85.
- Storm Lightning for SSE and VR v1.4.13: Added support for Anniversary Edition - 1.6.342 version.
- Animated Forge Water v0.5: Fix Elsopa anvil's missing heat effect (existing Elsopa anvil bug). 
- Enderal SE - Bears of the North v1.01:  Updated for Enderal 2.0.10.  Reduced the size of the bears slightly to avoid problems with melee range and pathing (still bigger than vanilla).
