Release date: December 18th, 2021

Updated Tools:
- DynDOLOD Standalone 3.0 Alpha-58: DynDOLOD is a set of simple tools based on xEdit/xLODGen to automatically create a Skyrim mod based on the load order which adds distant LOD for objects and trees to Skyrim. By combining DynDOLOD with xLODGen users can create drastically enhanced static object LOD + tree LOD and the new, optional dynamic distant object LOD in a few simple steps.

New Mods:
- Path of the Prophet (No Floating Quest Marker) v1.0: Removes floating quest markers from the game.  Quest markers are still viewable on the compass.
- Crash Logger VR v1.0: Generates crash logs when the game Just Worksâ„¢. This is a VR port using fudgyduff's MIT source.

- A Follower Named Ishan v1.2: Adds a custom voiced Qyranian follower at the Drunken Bee in Riverville.
