Added two DynDOLOD mods for selecting LODs optimized for performance versus quality. Use only one.

- For max performance, enable "DynDOLOD_Output_PERFORMANCE" in Mod Organizer 2. This uses "billboard1" trees at LOD Level 4 for maximum performance. Enabled by default.
- For max quality, enable "DynDOLOD_Output_QUALITY" in Mod Organizer 2. This uses "level0" trees at LOD Level 4 for greatly improved tree LODs. Results in -10fps in large open areas on an RTX 3070. Not recommended for wireless VR. Disabled by default.
